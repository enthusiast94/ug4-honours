# EdinFit

## Goal
The goal of this project was to make use of the newly-released Open Data API (https://tfe-opendata.readme.io/) made available by Transport for Edinburgh, to create a public transport mobile application that takes users from one place to another, while keeping them fit.

## Motivation
A study (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160316215131.htm) suggests that people who commute to their work place via public transport have a lower body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage than people who only commute via cars, implying that even the incidental physical activity involved in public transport journeys plays a crucial role in keeping a person fit. Another study (http://www.c3health.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/C3-report-on-walking-v-1-20120911.pdf) suggests that performing a non-vigorous physical activity like walking for just 30 minutes a day can increase cardiovascular fitness, strengthen bones, and increase muscle strength and endurance. On top of these health benefits, walking is also the simplest form of exercise, that requires minimal equipment, and can be done at any time of the day. However, the proportion of people that walk regularly has been declining steadily throughout the world in the last few decades (http://www.c3health.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/C3-report-on-walking-v-1-20120911.pdf). The major factor behind this decline is that nowadays people have a more stressful work life due to longer working hours and a faster work pace, and therefore they are not able to fit exercising into their daily routine. An easy solution to this problem is to simply make physical exercise a part of the journey to work. For example, people could walk to the next bus stop rather than just stand waiting for their bus, or perhaps they could leave the bus one or two stops earlier and walk to their destination from there. Doing something as simple as this can significantly improve their overall health. However, no public transport application available today is designed to assist people in doing so, as they only seem to focus on getting the user to their destination in the fastest way possible. Therefore, I wanted to create a mobile application that would not only take its users from one place to another, but at the same time, help them stay fit.

## Achievements 
I was able to develop and publish a fully functional public transport mobile application for Android devices that had the following key features:
- **Basic transport information:** Show live departure times for stops and
up-to-date weekly timetables for all bus services served by these stops. Users
can also view bus stops near their current location and can also add them
to a favourites list for quick navigation. Detailed walking directions along
with accurate duration and distance estimates to reach all bus stops are
displayed. Most of the transport information is available even when the
user is offline.
Wait-or-walk: Accurately estimate whether a user who is waiting for a
bus, has enough time to walk to one of the next stops and still have a high
probability of catching the bus.
- **Journey planner:** Come up with the shortest possible route to the destination,
taking into account the physical activity requirements input by the
user.
- **Physical activity statistics:** Provide detailed activity statistics for journeys
undertaken by users. This includes statistics like the number of steps
taken, number of calories burned, total distance travelled and the average
speed during the activity. The entire path travelled by the user is also
displayed on the map.
- **Live bus tracking:** View live bus locations throughput the different views
in the application.
- **Disruption notifications:** Alert the users by sending them notifications
regarding planned and incidental bus service disruptions.
- **Search:** Allow users to quickly search for bus stops and services.
